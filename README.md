# Whalebrew on Barge

https://github.com/bfirsh/whalebrew
> Whalebrew creates aliases for Docker images so you can run them as if they were native commands. It's like Homebrew, but everything you install is cleanly packaged up in a Docker image.

## Requirements

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

## Boot up

```bash
$ vagrant up
```

That's it.

## Hello World

```bash
$ vagrant ssh
